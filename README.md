* The Fibonacci Sequence -
 a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1.

* The difference in the loop and recursion model -
Loops - The loop model calculates the Fibonacci sequence using an iterative process, which involves using a loop to repeatedly calculate each Fibonacci number in sequence.

Recursion - The recursion model generates the Fibonacci sequence by defining the sequence in terms of itself. The function calls itself to calculate the preceding numbers.

* The Big O Notation for this algorithm and how you arrive at that conclusion -
